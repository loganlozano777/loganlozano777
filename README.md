Hi, I’m @loganlozano777

    I’m interested in relearning the basics in coding for ANSi C, beginning projects that I can write, understand, and debug efficiently. 
        I'm also interested in learning how to implement my C programming skills into embedded systems. 
        
    I’m currently learning on how to implement my basic C programming skills with microcontrollers. I am currently starting with small projects with the arduino uno.
        It's interesting learning the various things to keep in mind regarding sending the electrical signal to and from the arduino. For example, the beginning lab for the
        servo motor goes between a range of 0 to 180 degrees but I need to know how to put that into code by making it a value from 0 to 1023 for the potentiometer to read. 
        
    I’m looking to collaborate on various projects that can help build my skills regarding microcontrollers and embedded systems.
